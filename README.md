# Amazon-Inventory-Management-Server
"RiverBoat Server" is an Amazon Marketplace Web Service (Amazon MWS) inventory management application. The server accesses a list of customers from a remote database and then uses their Amazon MWS credentials to make calls to the Amazon API - synchronizing their seller inventory. 

# About This Project
This project is an example of my early attempts to create an e-commerce solution that would link Ebay and Amazon together as well as programming during my sophomore year. Feel free to use as  you see fit and give credit where due. Note: passwords and usernames have been removed.
